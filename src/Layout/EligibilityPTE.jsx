                    PTE Eligibility has no specific criteria other than age. People above 16 years of age are eligible to take the PTE exam. Those between 16 and 18 years old have to fill out and submit a parental consent form to be eligible for PTE. Individuals need not worry about the upper age limit as it is not mentioned by the official sources.

                    As many are concerned about the education qualifications, PTE has not mentioned any specific qualification students need. The universities or working organizations where they want to go would have the prerequisites. Students must have and carry a valid ID as identity proof. Also, they would decide the minimum PTE score that will make a candidate eligible for the particular purpose- study, work, or migrate to the UK, Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, or other countries.

                    Students must focus on improving their English Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening skills, which is the eligibility to grab abroad opportunities.
